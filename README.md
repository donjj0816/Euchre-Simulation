# Euchre-Simulation
Euchre is a card game popular in Michigan.  The learning goals of this project include Abstract Data Types in C++, Derived Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. C++-style Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and virtual functions.  I finally have a program that simulates a game of Euchre, supporting a AI player and a Human player.
